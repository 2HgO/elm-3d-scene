# elm-3d-scene

`elm-3d-scene` is a high-level Elm package for producing 3D graphics. It aims to
make creating 3D graphics as easy and enjoyable as possible, without having to
worry about low-level details like shader programs and transformation matrices
but still including powerful features such as:

- Efficient animated transformations
- Physically-based materials
- Multiple light sources
- Accurate shadows

The documentation for `elm-3d-scene` (including this README!) is still being
worked on, but once that is done (soon!) it will be published as a normal Elm
package. In the meantime, you can try out the package by checking out this
repository and then firing up `elm reactor` in [the examples
folder](https://github.com/ianmackenzie/elm-3d-scene/tree/master/examples).

Any questions/feedback, please open an issue or reach out to **@ianmackenzie**
on the [Elm Slack](https://elmlang.herokuapp.com)!
