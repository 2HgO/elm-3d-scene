# elm-3d-scene

`elm-3d-scene` is a high-level Elm package for producing 3D graphics. It aims to
make creating 3D graphics as easy and enjoyable as possible, without having to
worry about low-level details like shader programs and transformation matrices
but still including powerful features such as:

- Efficient animated transformations
- Physically-based materials
- Multiple light sources
- Accurate shadows

The documentation for `elm-3d-scene` (including this README!) is still being
worked on, but once that is done (soon!) it will be published as a normal Elm
package. In the meantime, you can try out the package by checking out this
repository and then firing up `elm reactor` in [the examples
folder](https://github.com/ianmackenzie/elm-3d-scene/tree/master/examples).

Any questions/feedback, please open an issue or reach out to **@ianmackenzie**
on the [Elm Slack](https://elmlang.herokuapp.com)!

## Climate action

I would like for the projects I work on to be as helpful as possible in
addressing the climate crisis. If

- you are working on a project that helps address the climate crisis (clean
  energy, public transit, reforestation, sustainable agriculture etc.) either as
  an individual, as part of an non-profit organization or even as part of a
  for-profit company, and
- there is a new feature you would find helpful for that work (or a bug you need
  fixed) in any of my open-source projects, then

please [open a new issue](https://github.com/ianmackenzie/elm-3d-scene/issues),
describe briefly what you're working on and I will treat that issue as high
priority.
