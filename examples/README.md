## `elm-3d-scene` examples

This directory contains several examples of using `elm-3d-scene` to create
different kinds of 3D graphics. From (roughly) simplest to most complex:

- `Points.elm`
- `LineSegments.elm`
- `Triangles.elm`
- `Translation.elm`
- `Rotation.elm`
- `Orbiting.elm`
- `Sphere.elm`
- `Spheres.elm`
- `Physics.elm`

To get started, check out this repository and start up `elm reactor` in this
directory, then start playing around with the different examples (or add your
own). Try animating things like color, translation, rotation, or lighting! If
you have questions, reach out in the **#webgl** channel or to **@ianmackenzie**
on the [Elm Slack](https://elmlang.herokuapp.com).
