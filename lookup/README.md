This directory contains a small C++ program that was used to generate lookup textures for ambient lighting, as described in the [course notes](http://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/s2013-shading-course/karis/s2013_pbs_epic_notes_v2.pdf) of the "Real Shading in Unreal Engine 4" session of the [Physically Based Shading in Theory and Practice](http://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/s2013-shading-course/) course at SIGGRAPH 2013. Now that the texture ([rgba.png](lookup/rgba.png)) has been generated, it's possible no one will ever have to compile and run this code again, but it's here just in case! (Incidentally, the included [lodepng](https://github.com/lvandeve/lodepng) source files are why GitHub shows this repository as being mostly C++ code instead of Elm...)
